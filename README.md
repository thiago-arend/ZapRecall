 <h1>Zap Recall</h1>
  <p>Zap Recall is a flashcard app designed to help you improve your memory and retention using the principles of active recall and spaced repetition. With Zap Recall, you can create flashcards that have a question or statement on the front and an answer on the back. By practicing with these flashcards, you can test your memory and reinforce your knowledge in a systematic and effective way.</p>
  <p>Here's how Zap Recall works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Active Recall:</strong> Read the question or statement on the front of the flashcard and try to remember the answer.</li>
    <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Depending on how well you remember the answer, Zap Recall schedules the flashcard to appear again at the right time for optimal learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Zap Moments:</strong> When you instantly recall the answer to a flashcard, you've had a "Zap!" moment, indicating strong memory retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Decks:</strong> Flashcards are organized into decks. The app comes with a default deck containing 8 flashcards.</li>
  </ul>
